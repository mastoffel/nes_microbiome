Description:

Package:              dada2
Type:                 Package
Title:                Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                      amplicon sequencing data
Description:          The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence
                      variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon
                      sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less
                      accurate OTU clustering approach. The dada2
                      pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
                      files, and outputs the sequence variants and
                      their sample-wise abundances after removing
                      substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                      classification is available via a native
                      implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                      classifier, and genus-species assignment by exact
                      matching.

          ‘FastqStreamer’.

       n: (Optional). ‘numeric(1)’. The maximum number of records
          (reads) to parse and dereplicate at any one time. This
          controls the peak memory requirement so that large fastq
          files are supported. Default is ‘1e6’, one-million reads. See

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The dada function takes as input dereplicated amplicon sequencing
     reads and returns the inferred composition of the sample (or
     samples). Put another way, dada removes all sequencing errors to
     reveal the members of the sequenced community.

     If dada is run in selfConsist=TRUE mode, the algorithm will infer
     both the sample composition and the parameters of its error model
     from the data.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     dada(derep, err, errorEstimationFunction = loessErrfun, selfConsist = FALSE,
       pool = FALSE, multithread = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   derep: (Required). A ‘derep-class’ object, the output of
          ‘derepFastq’. A list of such objects can be provided, in
          which case each will be denoised with a shared error model.

     err: (Required). 16xN numeric matrix, or an object coercible by
          ‘getErrors’ such as the output of the ‘learnErrors’ function.

          The matrix of estimated rates for each possible nucleotide
          transition (from sample nucleotide to read nucleotide). Rows
          correspond to the 16 possible transitions (t_ij) indexed such
          that 1:A->A, 2:A->C, ..., 16:T->T Columns correspond to
          quality scores. Each entry must be between 0 and 1.

          Typically there are 41 columns for the quality scores 0-40.
          However, if USE_QUALS=FALSE, the matrix must have only one
          column.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, ‘err’ can be set to NULL and an
          initial error matrix will be estimated from the data by
          assuming that all reads are errors away from one true
          sequence.

errorEstimationFunction: (Optional). Function. Default ‘loessErrfun’.

          If USE_QUALS = TRUE,
          ‘errorEstimationFunction(dada()$trans_out)’ is computed after
          sample inference, and the return value is used as the new
          estimate of the err matrix in $err_out.

          If USE_QUALS = FALSE, this argument is ignored, and
          transition rates are estimated by maximum likelihood (t_ij =
          n_ij/n_i).

selfConsist: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default FALSE.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, the algorithm will alternate between
          sample inference and error rate estimation until convergence.
          Error rate estimation is performed by
          ‘errorEstimationFunction’.

          If selfConsist=FALSE the algorithm performs one round of
          sample inference based on the provided ‘err’ matrix.

    pool: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default is FALSE.

          If pool = TRUE, the algorithm will pool together all samples
          prior to sample inference.  If pool = FALSE, sample inference
          is performed on each sample individually.

          This argument has no effect if only 1 sample is provided, and
          ‘pool’ does not affect error rates, which are always
          estimated from pooled observations across samples.

multithread: (Optional). Default is FALSE. If TRUE, multithreading is
          enabled and the number of available threads is automatically
          determined.  If an integer is provided, the number of threads
          to use is set by passing the argument on to
          ‘setThreadOptions’.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE.  Print verbose text output. More
          fine-grained control is available by providing an integer
          argument.

            • 0: Silence. No text output

            • 1: Minimal text output (same as FALSE).

            • 2: Detailed output (same as TRUE).

     ...: (Optional). All dada_opts can be passed in as arguments to
          the dada() function. See ‘setDadaOpt’ for a full list and
          description of these options.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Briefly, ‘dada’ implements a statistical test for the notion that
     a specific sequence was seen too many times to have been caused by
     amplicon errors from currently inferred sample sequences.
     Overly-abundant sequences are used as the seeds of new clusters of
     sequencing reads, and the final set of clusters is taken to
     represent the denoised composition of the sample. A more detailed
     explanation of the algorithm is found in two publications:

        • Callahan BJ, McMurdie PJ, Rosen MJ, Han AW, Johnson AJ,
          Holmes SP (2016). DADA2: High resolution sample inference
          from Illumina amplicon data. Nature Methods, 13(7), 581-3.

        • Rosen MJ, Callahan BJ, Fisher DS, Holmes SP (2012). Denoising
          PCR-amplified metagenome data. BMC bioinformatics, 13(1),
          283.

     ‘dada’ depends on a parametric error model of substitutions. Thus
     the quality of its sample inference is affected by the accuracy of
     the estimated error rates. ‘selfConsist’ mode allows these error
     rates to be inferred from the data.

     All comparisons between sequences performed by ‘dada’ depend on
     pairwise alignments. This step is the most computationally
     intensive part of the algorithm, and two alignment heuristics have
     been implemented for speed: A kmer-distance screen and banded
     Needleman-Wunsch alignmemt. See ‘setDadaOpt’.

Description:

Package:              dada2
Type:                 Package
Title:                Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                      amplicon sequencing data
Description:          The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence
                      variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon
                      sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less
                      accurate OTU clustering approach. The dada2
                      pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
                      files, and outputs the sequence variants and
                      their sample-wise abundances after removing
                      substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                      classification is available via a native
                      implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                      classifier, and genus-species assignment by exact
                      matching.

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A custom interface to ‘FastqStreamer’ for dereplicating amplicon
     sequences from fastq or compressed fastq files, while also
     controlling peak memory requirement to support large files.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     derepFastq(fls, n = 1e+06, verbose = FALSE)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     fls: (Required). ‘character’. The file path(s) to the fastq or
          fastq.gz file(s). Actually, any file format supported by
          ‘FastqStreamer’.

       n: (Optional). ‘numeric(1)’. The maximum number of records
          (reads) to parse and dereplicate at any one time. This
          controls the peak memory requirement so that large fastq
          files are supported. Default is ‘1e6’, one-million reads. See
          ‘FastqStreamer’ for details on this parameter, which is
          passed on.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE. If TRUE, throw standard R
          ‘message’s on the intermittent and final status of the
          dereplication.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A ‘derep-class’ object or list of such objects.

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The dada function takes as input dereplicated amplicon sequencing
     reads and returns the inferred composition of the sample (or
     samples). Put another way, dada removes all sequencing errors to
     reveal the members of the sequenced community.

     If dada is run in selfConsist=TRUE mode, the algorithm will infer
     both the sample composition and the parameters of its error model
     from the data.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     dada(derep, err, errorEstimationFunction = loessErrfun, selfConsist = FALSE,
       pool = FALSE, multithread = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   derep: (Required). A ‘derep-class’ object, the output of
          ‘derepFastq’. A list of such objects can be provided, in
          which case each will be denoised with a shared error model.

     err: (Required). 16xN numeric matrix, or an object coercible by
          ‘getErrors’ such as the output of the ‘learnErrors’ function.

          The matrix of estimated rates for each possible nucleotide
          transition (from sample nucleotide to read nucleotide). Rows
          correspond to the 16 possible transitions (t_ij) indexed such
          that 1:A->A, 2:A->C, ..., 16:T->T Columns correspond to
          quality scores. Each entry must be between 0 and 1.

          Typically there are 41 columns for the quality scores 0-40.
          However, if USE_QUALS=FALSE, the matrix must have only one
          column.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, ‘err’ can be set to NULL and an
          initial error matrix will be estimated from the data by
          assuming that all reads are errors away from one true
          sequence.

errorEstimationFunction: (Optional). Function. Default ‘loessErrfun’.

          If USE_QUALS = TRUE,
          ‘errorEstimationFunction(dada()$trans_out)’ is computed after
          sample inference, and the return value is used as the new
          estimate of the err matrix in $err_out.

          If USE_QUALS = FALSE, this argument is ignored, and
          transition rates are estimated by maximum likelihood (t_ij =
          n_ij/n_i).

selfConsist: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default FALSE.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, the algorithm will alternate between
          sample inference and error rate estimation until convergence.
          Error rate estimation is performed by
          ‘errorEstimationFunction’.

          If selfConsist=FALSE the algorithm performs one round of
          sample inference based on the provided ‘err’ matrix.

    pool: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default is FALSE.

          If pool = TRUE, the algorithm will pool together all samples
          prior to sample inference.  If pool = FALSE, sample inference
          is performed on each sample individually.

          This argument has no effect if only 1 sample is provided, and
          ‘pool’ does not affect error rates, which are always
          estimated from pooled observations across samples.

multithread: (Optional). Default is FALSE. If TRUE, multithreading is
          enabled and the number of available threads is automatically
          determined.  If an integer is provided, the number of threads
          to use is set by passing the argument on to
          ‘setThreadOptions’.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE.  Print verbose text output. More
          fine-grained control is available by providing an integer
          argument.

            • 0: Silence. No text output

            • 1: Minimal text output (same as FALSE).

            • 2: Detailed output (same as TRUE).

     ...: (Optional). All dada_opts can be passed in as arguments to

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Briefly, ‘dada’ implements a statistical test for the notion that
     a specific sequence was seen too many times to have been caused by
     amplicon errors from currently inferred sample sequences.
     Overly-abundant sequences are used as the seeds of new clusters of
     sequencing reads, and the final set of clusters is taken to
     represent the denoised composition of the sample. A more detailed
     explanation of the algorithm is found in two publications:

        • Callahan BJ, McMurdie PJ, Rosen MJ, Han AW, Johnson AJ,
          Holmes SP (2016). DADA2: High resolution sample inference
          from Illumina amplicon data. Nature Methods, 13(7), 581-3.

        • Rosen MJ, Callahan BJ, Fisher DS, Holmes SP (2012). Denoising
          PCR-amplified metagenome data. BMC bioinformatics, 13(1),
          283.

     ‘dada’ depends on a parametric error model of substitutions. Thus
     the quality of its sample inference is affected by the accuracy of
     the estimated error rates. ‘selfConsist’ mode allows these error
     rates to be inferred from the data.

     All comparisons between sequences performed by ‘dada’ depend on
     pairwise alignments. This step is the most computationally
     intensive part of the algorithm, and two alignment heuristics have
     been implemented for speed: A kmer-distance screen and banded
     Needleman-Wunsch alignmemt. See ‘setDadaOpt’.

Description:

Package:              dada2
Type:                 Package
Title:                Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                      amplicon sequencing data
Description:          The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence
                      variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon
                      sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less
                      accurate OTU clustering approach. The dada2
                      pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
                      files, and outputs the sequence variants and
                      their sample-wise abundances after removing
                      substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                      classification is available via a native
                      implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                      classifier, and genus-species assignment by exact
                      matching.

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A custom interface to ‘FastqStreamer’ for dereplicating amplicon
     sequences from fastq or compressed fastq files, while also
     controlling peak memory requirement to support large files.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     derepFastq(fls, n = 1e+06, verbose = FALSE)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     fls: (Required). ‘character’. The file path(s) to the fastq or
          fastq.gz file(s). Actually, any file format supported by
          ‘FastqStreamer’.

       n: (Optional). ‘numeric(1)’. The maximum number of records
          (reads) to parse and dereplicate at any one time. This
          controls the peak memory requirement so that large fastq
          files are supported. Default is ‘1e6’, one-million reads. See
          ‘FastqStreamer’ for details on this parameter, which is
          passed on.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE. If TRUE, throw standard R
          ‘message’s on the intermittent and final status of the
          dereplication.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A ‘derep-class’ object or list of such objects.

     The dada function takes as input dereplicated amplicon sequencing
     reads and returns the inferred composition of the sample (or
     samples). Put another way, dada removes all sequencing errors to
     reveal the members of the sequenced community.

     If dada is run in selfConsist=TRUE mode, the algorithm will infer
     both the sample composition and the parameters of its error model
     from the data.

       pool = FALSE, multithread = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   derep: (Required). A ‘derep-class’ object, the output of
          ‘derepFastq’. A list of such objects can be provided, in
          which case each will be denoised with a shared error model.

     err: (Required). 16xN numeric matrix, or an object coercible by
          ‘getErrors’ such as the output of the ‘learnErrors’ function.

          The matrix of estimated rates for each possible nucleotide
          transition (from sample nucleotide to read nucleotide). Rows
          correspond to the 16 possible transitions (t_ij) indexed such
          that 1:A->A, 2:A->C, ..., 16:T->T Columns correspond to
          quality scores. Each entry must be between 0 and 1.

          Typically there are 41 columns for the quality scores 0-40.
          However, if USE_QUALS=FALSE, the matrix must have only one
          column.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, ‘err’ can be set to NULL and an
          initial error matrix will be estimated from the data by
          assuming that all reads are errors away from one true
          sequence.

errorEstimationFunction: (Optional). Function. Default ‘loessErrfun’.

          If USE_QUALS = TRUE,
          ‘errorEstimationFunction(dada()$trans_out)’ is computed after
          sample inference, and the return value is used as the new
          estimate of the err matrix in $err_out.

          If USE_QUALS = FALSE, this argument is ignored, and
          transition rates are estimated by maximum likelihood (t_ij =
          n_ij/n_i).

selfConsist: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default FALSE.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, the algorithm will alternate between
          sample inference and error rate estimation until convergence.
          Error rate estimation is performed by
          ‘errorEstimationFunction’.

          If selfConsist=FALSE the algorithm performs one round of
          sample inference based on the provided ‘err’ matrix.

    pool: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default is FALSE.

          If pool = TRUE, the algorithm will pool together all samples
          prior to sample inference.  If pool = FALSE, sample inference
          is performed on each sample individually.

          This argument has no effect if only 1 sample is provided, and
          ‘pool’ does not affect error rates, which are always
          estimated from pooled observations across samples.

multithread: (Optional). Default is FALSE. If TRUE, multithreading is
          enabled and the number of available threads is automatically
          determined.  If an integer is provided, the number of threads
          to use is set by passing the argument on to
          ‘setThreadOptions’.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE.  Print verbose text output. More
          fine-grained control is available by providing an integer
          argument.

            • 0: Silence. No text output

            • 1: Minimal text output (same as FALSE).

            • 2: Detailed output (same as TRUE).

     ...: (Optional). All dada_opts can be passed in as arguments to
          the dada() function. See ‘setDadaOpt’ for a full list and
          description of these options.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Briefly, ‘dada’ implements a statistical test for the notion that
     a specific sequence was seen too many times to have been caused by
     amplicon errors from currently inferred sample sequences.
     Overly-abundant sequences are used as the seeds of new clusters of
     sequencing reads, and the final set of clusters is taken to
     represent the denoised composition of the sample. A more detailed
     explanation of the algorithm is found in two publications:

        • Callahan BJ, McMurdie PJ, Rosen MJ, Han AW, Johnson AJ,
          Holmes SP (2016). DADA2: High resolution sample inference
          from Illumina amplicon data. Nature Methods, 13(7), 581-3.

        • Rosen MJ, Callahan BJ, Fisher DS, Holmes SP (2012). Denoising
          PCR-amplified metagenome data. BMC bioinformatics, 13(1),
          283.

     ‘dada’ depends on a parametric error model of substitutions. Thus
     the quality of its sample inference is affected by the accuracy of
     the estimated error rates. ‘selfConsist’ mode allows these error
     rates to be inferred from the data.

     All comparisons between sequences performed by ‘dada’ depend on
     pairwise alignments. This step is the most computationally
     intensive part of the algorithm, and two alignment heuristics have
     been implemented for speed: A kmer-distance screen and banded
     Needleman-Wunsch alignmemt. See ‘setDadaOpt’.

Description:

Package:              dada2
Type:                 Package
Title:                Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                      amplicon sequencing data
Description:          The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence
                      variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon
                      sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less
                      accurate OTU clustering approach. The dada2
                      pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
                      files, and outputs the sequence variants and
                      their sample-wise abundances after removing
                      substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                      classification is available via a native
                      implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                      classifier, and genus-species assignment by exact
                      matching.

     fls: (Required). ‘character’. The file path(s) to the fastq or
          fastq.gz file(s). Actually, any file format supported by
          ‘FastqStreamer’.

       n: (Optional). ‘numeric(1)’. The maximum number of records
          (reads) to parse and dereplicate at any one time. This
          controls the peak memory requirement so that large fastq
          files are supported. Default is ‘1e6’, one-million reads. See

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The dada function takes as input dereplicated amplicon sequencing
     reads and returns the inferred composition of the sample (or
     samples). Put another way, dada removes all sequencing errors to
     reveal the members of the sequenced community.

     If dada is run in selfConsist=TRUE mode, the algorithm will infer
     both the sample composition and the parameters of its error model
     from the data.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     dada(derep, err, errorEstimationFunction = loessErrfun, selfConsist = FALSE,
       pool = FALSE, multithread = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   derep: (Required). A ‘derep-class’ object, the output of
          ‘derepFastq’. A list of such objects can be provided, in
          which case each will be denoised with a shared error model.

     err: (Required). 16xN numeric matrix, or an object coercible by
          ‘getErrors’ such as the output of the ‘learnErrors’ function.

          The matrix of estimated rates for each possible nucleotide
          transition (from sample nucleotide to read nucleotide). Rows
          correspond to the 16 possible transitions (t_ij) indexed such
          that 1:A->A, 2:A->C, ..., 16:T->T Columns correspond to
          quality scores. Each entry must be between 0 and 1.

          Typically there are 41 columns for the quality scores 0-40.
          However, if USE_QUALS=FALSE, the matrix must have only one
          column.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, ‘err’ can be set to NULL and an
          initial error matrix will be estimated from the data by
          assuming that all reads are errors away from one true
          sequence.

errorEstimationFunction: (Optional). Function. Default ‘loessErrfun’.

          If USE_QUALS = TRUE,
          ‘errorEstimationFunction(dada()$trans_out)’ is computed after
          sample inference, and the return value is used as the new
          estimate of the err matrix in $err_out.

          If USE_QUALS = FALSE, this argument is ignored, and
          transition rates are estimated by maximum likelihood (t_ij =
          n_ij/n_i).

selfConsist: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default FALSE.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, the algorithm will alternate between
          sample inference and error rate estimation until convergence.
          Error rate estimation is performed by
          ‘errorEstimationFunction’.

          If selfConsist=FALSE the algorithm performs one round of
          sample inference based on the provided ‘err’ matrix.

    pool: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default is FALSE.

          If pool = TRUE, the algorithm will pool together all samples
          prior to sample inference.  If pool = FALSE, sample inference
          is performed on each sample individually.

          This argument has no effect if only 1 sample is provided, and
          ‘pool’ does not affect error rates, which are always
          estimated from pooled observations across samples.

multithread: (Optional). Default is FALSE. If TRUE, multithreading is
          enabled and the number of available threads is automatically
          determined.  If an integer is provided, the number of threads
          to use is set by passing the argument on to
          ‘setThreadOptions’.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE.  Print verbose text output. More
          fine-grained control is available by providing an integer
          argument.

            • 0: Silence. No text output

            • 1: Minimal text output (same as FALSE).

            • 2: Detailed output (same as TRUE).

     ...: (Optional). All dada_opts can be passed in as arguments to
          the dada() function. See ‘setDadaOpt’ for a full list and
          description of these options.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Briefly, ‘dada’ implements a statistical test for the notion that
     a specific sequence was seen too many times to have been caused by
     amplicon errors from currently inferred sample sequences.
     Overly-abundant sequences are used as the seeds of new clusters of
     sequencing reads, and the final set of clusters is taken to
     represent the denoised composition of the sample. A more detailed
     explanation of the algorithm is found in two publications:

        • Callahan BJ, McMurdie PJ, Rosen MJ, Han AW, Johnson AJ,
          Holmes SP (2016). DADA2: High resolution sample inference
          from Illumina amplicon data. Nature Methods, 13(7), 581-3.

        • Rosen MJ, Callahan BJ, Fisher DS, Holmes SP (2012). Denoising
          PCR-amplified metagenome data. BMC bioinformatics, 13(1),
          283.

     ‘dada’ depends on a parametric error model of substitutions. Thus
     the quality of its sample inference is affected by the accuracy of
     the estimated error rates. ‘selfConsist’ mode allows these error
     rates to be inferred from the data.

     All comparisons between sequences performed by ‘dada’ depend on
     pairwise alignments. This step is the most computationally
     intensive part of the algorithm, and two alignment heuristics have
     been implemented for speed: A kmer-distance screen and banded
     Needleman-Wunsch alignmemt. See ‘setDadaOpt’.

Description:

Package:              dada2
Type:                 Package
Title:                Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                      amplicon sequencing data
Description:          The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence
                      variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon
                      sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less
                      accurate OTU clustering approach. The dada2
                      pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
                      files, and outputs the sequence variants and
                      their sample-wise abundances after removing
                      substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                      classification is available via a native
                      implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                      classifier, and genus-species assignment by exact
                      matching.

          ‘FastqStreamer’.

       n: (Optional). ‘numeric(1)’. The maximum number of records
          (reads) to parse and dereplicate at any one time. This
          controls the peak memory requirement so that large fastq
          files are supported. Default is ‘1e6’, one-million reads. See

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The dada function takes as input dereplicated amplicon sequencing
     reads and returns the inferred composition of the sample (or
     samples). Put another way, dada removes all sequencing errors to
     reveal the members of the sequenced community.

     If dada is run in selfConsist=TRUE mode, the algorithm will infer
     both the sample composition and the parameters of its error model
     from the data.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     dada(derep, err, errorEstimationFunction = loessErrfun, selfConsist = FALSE,
       pool = FALSE, multithread = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   derep: (Required). A ‘derep-class’ object, the output of
          ‘derepFastq’. A list of such objects can be provided, in
          which case each will be denoised with a shared error model.

     err: (Required). 16xN numeric matrix, or an object coercible by
          ‘getErrors’ such as the output of the ‘learnErrors’ function.

          The matrix of estimated rates for each possible nucleotide
          transition (from sample nucleotide to read nucleotide). Rows
          correspond to the 16 possible transitions (t_ij) indexed such
          that 1:A->A, 2:A->C, ..., 16:T->T Columns correspond to
          quality scores. Each entry must be between 0 and 1.

          Typically there are 41 columns for the quality scores 0-40.
          However, if USE_QUALS=FALSE, the matrix must have only one
          column.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, ‘err’ can be set to NULL and an
          initial error matrix will be estimated from the data by
          assuming that all reads are errors away from one true
          sequence.

errorEstimationFunction: (Optional). Function. Default ‘loessErrfun’.

          If USE_QUALS = TRUE,
          ‘errorEstimationFunction(dada()$trans_out)’ is computed after
          sample inference, and the return value is used as the new
          estimate of the err matrix in $err_out.

          If USE_QUALS = FALSE, this argument is ignored, and
          transition rates are estimated by maximum likelihood (t_ij =
          n_ij/n_i).

selfConsist: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default FALSE.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, the algorithm will alternate between
          sample inference and error rate estimation until convergence.
          Error rate estimation is performed by
          ‘errorEstimationFunction’.

          If selfConsist=FALSE the algorithm performs one round of
          sample inference based on the provided ‘err’ matrix.

    pool: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default is FALSE.

          If pool = TRUE, the algorithm will pool together all samples
          prior to sample inference.  If pool = FALSE, sample inference
          is performed on each sample individually.

          This argument has no effect if only 1 sample is provided, and
          ‘pool’ does not affect error rates, which are always
          estimated from pooled observations across samples.

multithread: (Optional). Default is FALSE. If TRUE, multithreading is
          enabled and the number of available threads is automatically
          determined.  If an integer is provided, the number of threads
          to use is set by passing the argument on to
          ‘setThreadOptions’.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE.  Print verbose text output. More
          fine-grained control is available by providing an integer
          argument.

            • 0: Silence. No text output

            • 1: Minimal text output (same as FALSE).

            • 2: Detailed output (same as TRUE).

     ...: (Optional). All dada_opts can be passed in as arguments to
          the dada() function. See ‘setDadaOpt’ for a full list and
          description of these options.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Briefly, ‘dada’ implements a statistical test for the notion that
     a specific sequence was seen too many times to have been caused by
     amplicon errors from currently inferred sample sequences.
     Overly-abundant sequences are used as the seeds of new clusters of
     sequencing reads, and the final set of clusters is taken to
     represent the denoised composition of the sample. A more detailed
     explanation of the algorithm is found in two publications:

        • Callahan BJ, McMurdie PJ, Rosen MJ, Han AW, Johnson AJ,
          Holmes SP (2016). DADA2: High resolution sample inference
          from Illumina amplicon data. Nature Methods, 13(7), 581-3.

        • Rosen MJ, Callahan BJ, Fisher DS, Holmes SP (2012). Denoising
          PCR-amplified metagenome data. BMC bioinformatics, 13(1),
          283.

     ‘dada’ depends on a parametric error model of substitutions. Thus
     the quality of its sample inference is affected by the accuracy of
     the estimated error rates. ‘selfConsist’ mode allows these error
     rates to be inferred from the data.

     All comparisons between sequences performed by ‘dada’ depend on
     pairwise alignments. This step is the most computationally
     intensive part of the algorithm, and two alignment heuristics have
     been implemented for speed: A kmer-distance screen and banded
     Needleman-Wunsch alignmemt. See ‘setDadaOpt’.

Description:

Package:              dada2
Type:                 Package
Title:                Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                      amplicon sequencing data
Description:          The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence
                      variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon
                      sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less
                      accurate OTU clustering approach. The dada2
                      pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
                      files, and outputs the sequence variants and
                      their sample-wise abundances after removing
                      substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                      classification is available via a native
                      implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                      classifier, and genus-species assignment by exact
                      matching.

     A custom interface to ‘FastqStreamer’ for dereplicating amplicon
     sequences from fastq or compressed fastq files, while also
     controlling peak memory requirement to support large files.

     derepFastq(fls, n = 1e+06, verbose = FALSE)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     fls: (Required). ‘character’. The file path(s) to the fastq or
          fastq.gz file(s). Actually, any file format supported by
          ‘FastqStreamer’.

       n: (Optional). ‘numeric(1)’. The maximum number of records
          (reads) to parse and dereplicate at any one time. This
          controls the peak memory requirement so that large fastq
          files are supported. Default is ‘1e6’, one-million reads. See
          ‘FastqStreamer’ for details on this parameter, which is
          passed on.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE. If TRUE, throw standard R
          ‘message’s on the intermittent and final status of the
          dereplication.

_V_a_l_u_e:

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The dada function takes as input dereplicated amplicon sequencing
     reads and returns the inferred composition of the sample (or
     samples). Put another way, dada removes all sequencing errors to
     reveal the members of the sequenced community.

     If dada is run in selfConsist=TRUE mode, the algorithm will infer
     both the sample composition and the parameters of its error model
     from the data.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     dada(derep, err, errorEstimationFunction = loessErrfun, selfConsist = FALSE,
       pool = FALSE, multithread = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   derep: (Required). A ‘derep-class’ object, the output of
          ‘derepFastq’. A list of such objects can be provided, in
          which case each will be denoised with a shared error model.

     err: (Required). 16xN numeric matrix, or an object coercible by
          ‘getErrors’ such as the output of the ‘learnErrors’ function.

          The matrix of estimated rates for each possible nucleotide
          transition (from sample nucleotide to read nucleotide). Rows
          correspond to the 16 possible transitions (t_ij) indexed such
          that 1:A->A, 2:A->C, ..., 16:T->T Columns correspond to
          quality scores. Each entry must be between 0 and 1.

          Typically there are 41 columns for the quality scores 0-40.
          However, if USE_QUALS=FALSE, the matrix must have only one
          column.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, ‘err’ can be set to NULL and an
          initial error matrix will be estimated from the data by
          assuming that all reads are errors away from one true
          sequence.

errorEstimationFunction: (Optional). Function. Default ‘loessErrfun’.

          If USE_QUALS = TRUE,
          ‘errorEstimationFunction(dada()$trans_out)’ is computed after
          sample inference, and the return value is used as the new
          estimate of the err matrix in $err_out.

          If USE_QUALS = FALSE, this argument is ignored, and
          transition rates are estimated by maximum likelihood (t_ij =
          n_ij/n_i).

selfConsist: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default FALSE.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, the algorithm will alternate between
          sample inference and error rate estimation until convergence.
          Error rate estimation is performed by
          ‘errorEstimationFunction’.

          If selfConsist=FALSE the algorithm performs one round of
          sample inference based on the provided ‘err’ matrix.

    pool: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default is FALSE.

          If pool = TRUE, the algorithm will pool together all samples
          prior to sample inference.  If pool = FALSE, sample inference
          is performed on each sample individually.

          This argument has no effect if only 1 sample is provided, and
          ‘pool’ does not affect error rates, which are always
          estimated from pooled observations across samples.

multithread: (Optional). Default is FALSE. If TRUE, multithreading is
          enabled and the number of available threads is automatically
          determined.  If an integer is provided, the number of threads
          to use is set by passing the argument on to
          ‘setThreadOptions’.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE.  Print verbose text output. More
          fine-grained control is available by providing an integer
          argument.

            • 0: Silence. No text output

            • 1: Minimal text output (same as FALSE).

            • 2: Detailed output (same as TRUE).

     ...: (Optional). All dada_opts can be passed in as arguments to
          the dada() function. See ‘setDadaOpt’ for a full list and
          description of these options.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Briefly, ‘dada’ implements a statistical test for the notion that
     a specific sequence was seen too many times to have been caused by
     amplicon errors from currently inferred sample sequences.
     Overly-abundant sequences are used as the seeds of new clusters of
     sequencing reads, and the final set of clusters is taken to
     represent the denoised composition of the sample. A more detailed
     explanation of the algorithm is found in two publications:

        • Callahan BJ, McMurdie PJ, Rosen MJ, Han AW, Johnson AJ,
          Holmes SP (2016). DADA2: High resolution sample inference
          from Illumina amplicon data. Nature Methods, 13(7), 581-3.

        • Rosen MJ, Callahan BJ, Fisher DS, Holmes SP (2012). Denoising
          PCR-amplified metagenome data. BMC bioinformatics, 13(1),
          283.

     ‘dada’ depends on a parametric error model of substitutions. Thus
     the quality of its sample inference is affected by the accuracy of
     the estimated error rates. ‘selfConsist’ mode allows these error
     rates to be inferred from the data.

     All comparisons between sequences performed by ‘dada’ depend on
     pairwise alignments. This step is the most computationally
     intensive part of the algorithm, and two alignment heuristics have
     been implemented for speed: A kmer-distance screen and banded
     Needleman-Wunsch alignmemt. See ‘setDadaOpt’.

Description:

Package:              dada2
Type:                 Package
Title:                Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                      amplicon sequencing data
Description:          The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence
                      variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon
                      sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less
                      accurate OTU clustering approach. The dada2
                      pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
                      files, and outputs the sequence variants and
                      their sample-wise abundances after removing
                      substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                      classification is available via a native
                      implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                      classifier, and genus-species assignment by exact
                      matching.

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A custom interface to ‘FastqStreamer’ for dereplicating amplicon
     sequences from fastq or compressed fastq files, while also
     controlling peak memory requirement to support large files.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     derepFastq(fls, n = 1e+06, verbose = FALSE)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     fls: (Required). ‘character’. The file path(s) to the fastq or
          fastq.gz file(s). Actually, any file format supported by
          ‘FastqStreamer’.

       n: (Optional). ‘numeric(1)’. The maximum number of records
          (reads) to parse and dereplicate at any one time. This
          controls the peak memory requirement so that large fastq
          files are supported. Default is ‘1e6’, one-million reads. See
          ‘FastqStreamer’ for details on this parameter, which is
          passed on.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE. If TRUE, throw standard R
          ‘message’s on the intermittent and final status of the
          dereplication.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A ‘derep-class’ object or list of such objects.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     # Test that chunk-size, `n`, does not affect the result.
     testFastq = system.file("extdata", "sam1F.fastq.gz", package="dada2")
     derep1 = derepFastq(testFastq, verbose = TRUE)

     The dada function takes as input dereplicated amplicon sequencing
     reads and returns the inferred composition of the sample (or
     samples). Put another way, dada removes all sequencing errors to
     reveal the members of the sequenced community.

     If dada is run in selfConsist=TRUE mode, the algorithm will infer
     both the sample composition and the parameters of its error model
     from the data.

     dada(derep, err, errorEstimationFunction = loessErrfun, selfConsist = FALSE,
       pool = FALSE, multithread = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   derep: (Required). A ‘derep-class’ object, the output of
          ‘derepFastq’. A list of such objects can be provided, in
          which case each will be denoised with a shared error model.

     err: (Required). 16xN numeric matrix, or an object coercible by
          ‘getErrors’ such as the output of the ‘learnErrors’ function.

          The matrix of estimated rates for each possible nucleotide
          transition (from sample nucleotide to read nucleotide). Rows
          correspond to the 16 possible transitions (t_ij) indexed such
          that 1:A->A, 2:A->C, ..., 16:T->T Columns correspond to
          quality scores. Each entry must be between 0 and 1.

          Typically there are 41 columns for the quality scores 0-40.
          However, if USE_QUALS=FALSE, the matrix must have only one
          column.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, ‘err’ can be set to NULL and an
          initial error matrix will be estimated from the data by
          assuming that all reads are errors away from one true
          sequence.

errorEstimationFunction: (Optional). Function. Default ‘loessErrfun’.

          If USE_QUALS = TRUE,
          ‘errorEstimationFunction(dada()$trans_out)’ is computed after
          sample inference, and the return value is used as the new
          estimate of the err matrix in $err_out.

          If USE_QUALS = FALSE, this argument is ignored, and
          transition rates are estimated by maximum likelihood (t_ij =
          n_ij/n_i).

selfConsist: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default FALSE.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, the algorithm will alternate between
          sample inference and error rate estimation until convergence.
          Error rate estimation is performed by
          ‘errorEstimationFunction’.

          If selfConsist=FALSE the algorithm performs one round of
          sample inference based on the provided ‘err’ matrix.

    pool: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default is FALSE.

          If pool = TRUE, the algorithm will pool together all samples
          prior to sample inference.  If pool = FALSE, sample inference
          is performed on each sample individually.

          This argument has no effect if only 1 sample is provided, and
          ‘pool’ does not affect error rates, which are always
          estimated from pooled observations across samples.

multithread: (Optional). Default is FALSE. If TRUE, multithreading is
          enabled and the number of available threads is automatically
          determined.  If an integer is provided, the number of threads
          to use is set by passing the argument on to
          ‘setThreadOptions’.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE.  Print verbose text output. More
          fine-grained control is available by providing an integer
          argument.

            • 0: Silence. No text output

            • 1: Minimal text output (same as FALSE).

            • 2: Detailed output (same as TRUE).

     ...: (Optional). All dada_opts can be passed in as arguments to
          the dada() function. See ‘setDadaOpt’ for a full list and
          description of these options.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Briefly, ‘dada’ implements a statistical test for the notion that
     a specific sequence was seen too many times to have been caused by
     amplicon errors from currently inferred sample sequences.
     Overly-abundant sequences are used as the seeds of new clusters of
     sequencing reads, and the final set of clusters is taken to
     represent the denoised composition of the sample. A more detailed
     explanation of the algorithm is found in two publications:

        • Callahan BJ, McMurdie PJ, Rosen MJ, Han AW, Johnson AJ,
          Holmes SP (2016). DADA2: High resolution sample inference
          from Illumina amplicon data. Nature Methods, 13(7), 581-3.

        • Rosen MJ, Callahan BJ, Fisher DS, Holmes SP (2012). Denoising
          PCR-amplified metagenome data. BMC bioinformatics, 13(1),
          283.

     ‘dada’ depends on a parametric error model of substitutions. Thus
     the quality of its sample inference is affected by the accuracy of
     the estimated error rates. ‘selfConsist’ mode allows these error
     rates to be inferred from the data.

     All comparisons between sequences performed by ‘dada’ depend on
     pairwise alignments. This step is the most computationally
     intensive part of the algorithm, and two alignment heuristics have
     been implemented for speed: A kmer-distance screen and banded
     Needleman-Wunsch alignmemt. See ‘setDadaOpt’.

Description:

Package:              dada2
Type:                 Package
Title:                Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                      amplicon sequencing data
Description:          The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence
                      variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon
                      sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less
                      accurate OTU clustering approach. The dada2
                      pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
                      files, and outputs the sequence variants and
                      their sample-wise abundances after removing
                      substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                      classification is available via a native
                      implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                      classifier, and genus-species assignment by exact
                      matching.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     fls: (Required). ‘character’. The file path(s) to the fastq or
          fastq.gz file(s). Actually, any file format supported by
          ‘FastqStreamer’.

       n: (Optional). ‘numeric(1)’. The maximum number of records
          (reads) to parse and dereplicate at any one time. This
          controls the peak memory requirement so that large fastq
          files are supported. Default is ‘1e6’, one-million reads. See

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The dada function takes as input dereplicated amplicon sequencing
     reads and returns the inferred composition of the sample (or
     samples). Put another way, dada removes all sequencing errors to
     reveal the members of the sequenced community.

     If dada is run in selfConsist=TRUE mode, the algorithm will infer
     both the sample composition and the parameters of its error model
     from the data.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     dada(derep, err, errorEstimationFunction = loessErrfun, selfConsist = FALSE,
       pool = FALSE, multithread = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   derep: (Required). A ‘derep-class’ object, the output of
          ‘derepFastq’. A list of such objects can be provided, in
          which case each will be denoised with a shared error model.

     err: (Required). 16xN numeric matrix, or an object coercible by
          ‘getErrors’ such as the output of the ‘learnErrors’ function.

          The matrix of estimated rates for each possible nucleotide
          transition (from sample nucleotide to read nucleotide). Rows
          correspond to the 16 possible transitions (t_ij) indexed such
          that 1:A->A, 2:A->C, ..., 16:T->T Columns correspond to
          quality scores. Each entry must be between 0 and 1.

          Typically there are 41 columns for the quality scores 0-40.
          However, if USE_QUALS=FALSE, the matrix must have only one
          column.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, ‘err’ can be set to NULL and an
          initial error matrix will be estimated from the data by
          assuming that all reads are errors away from one true
          sequence.

errorEstimationFunction: (Optional). Function. Default ‘loessErrfun’.

          If USE_QUALS = TRUE,
          ‘errorEstimationFunction(dada()$trans_out)’ is computed after
          sample inference, and the return value is used as the new
          estimate of the err matrix in $err_out.

          If USE_QUALS = FALSE, this argument is ignored, and
          transition rates are estimated by maximum likelihood (t_ij =
          n_ij/n_i).

selfConsist: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default FALSE.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, the algorithm will alternate between
          sample inference and error rate estimation until convergence.
          Error rate estimation is performed by
          ‘errorEstimationFunction’.

          If selfConsist=FALSE the algorithm performs one round of
          sample inference based on the provided ‘err’ matrix.

    pool: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default is FALSE.

          If pool = TRUE, the algorithm will pool together all samples
          prior to sample inference.  If pool = FALSE, sample inference
          is performed on each sample individually.

          This argument has no effect if only 1 sample is provided, and
          ‘pool’ does not affect error rates, which are always
          estimated from pooled observations across samples.

multithread: (Optional). Default is FALSE. If TRUE, multithreading is
          enabled and the number of available threads is automatically
          determined.  If an integer is provided, the number of threads
          to use is set by passing the argument on to
          ‘setThreadOptions’.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE.  Print verbose text output. More
          fine-grained control is available by providing an integer
          argument.

            • 0: Silence. No text output

            • 1: Minimal text output (same as FALSE).

            • 2: Detailed output (same as TRUE).

     ...: (Optional). All dada_opts can be passed in as arguments to
          the dada() function. See ‘setDadaOpt’ for a full list and
          description of these options.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Briefly, ‘dada’ implements a statistical test for the notion that
     a specific sequence was seen too many times to have been caused by
     amplicon errors from currently inferred sample sequences.
     Overly-abundant sequences are used as the seeds of new clusters of
     sequencing reads, and the final set of clusters is taken to
     represent the denoised composition of the sample. A more detailed
     explanation of the algorithm is found in two publications:

        • Callahan BJ, McMurdie PJ, Rosen MJ, Han AW, Johnson AJ,
          Holmes SP (2016). DADA2: High resolution sample inference
          from Illumina amplicon data. Nature Methods, 13(7), 581-3.

        • Rosen MJ, Callahan BJ, Fisher DS, Holmes SP (2012). Denoising
          PCR-amplified metagenome data. BMC bioinformatics, 13(1),
          283.

     ‘dada’ depends on a parametric error model of substitutions. Thus
     the quality of its sample inference is affected by the accuracy of
     the estimated error rates. ‘selfConsist’ mode allows these error
     rates to be inferred from the data.

     All comparisons between sequences performed by ‘dada’ depend on
     pairwise alignments. This step is the most computationally
     intensive part of the algorithm, and two alignment heuristics have
     been implemented for speed: A kmer-distance screen and banded
     Needleman-Wunsch alignmemt. See ‘setDadaOpt’.

Description:

Package:              dada2
Type:                 Package
Title:                Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                      amplicon sequencing data
Description:          The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence
                      variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon
                      sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less
                      accurate OTU clustering approach. The dada2
                      pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
                      files, and outputs the sequence variants and
                      their sample-wise abundances after removing
                      substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                      classification is available via a native
                      implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                      classifier, and genus-species assignment by exact
                      matching.

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A custom interface to ‘FastqStreamer’ for dereplicating amplicon
     sequences from fastq or compressed fastq files, while also
     controlling peak memory requirement to support large files.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     derepFastq(fls, n = 1e+06, verbose = FALSE)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     fls: (Required). ‘character’. The file path(s) to the fastq or
          fastq.gz file(s). Actually, any file format supported by
          ‘FastqStreamer’.

       n: (Optional). ‘numeric(1)’. The maximum number of records
          (reads) to parse and dereplicate at any one time. This
          controls the peak memory requirement so that large fastq
          files are supported. Default is ‘1e6’, one-million reads. See
          ‘FastqStreamer’ for details on this parameter, which is
          passed on.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE. If TRUE, throw standard R
          ‘message’s on the intermittent and final status of the
          dereplication.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A ‘derep-class’ object or list of such objects.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     # Test that chunk-size, `n`, does not affect the result.
     testFastq = system.file("extdata", "sam1F.fastq.gz", package="dada2")

     The dada function takes as input dereplicated amplicon sequencing
     reads and returns the inferred composition of the sample (or
     samples). Put another way, dada removes all sequencing errors to
     reveal the members of the sequenced community.

     If dada is run in selfConsist=TRUE mode, the algorithm will infer
     both the sample composition and the parameters of its error model
     from the data.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     dada(derep, err, errorEstimationFunction = loessErrfun, selfConsist = FALSE,
       pool = FALSE, multithread = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   derep: (Required). A ‘derep-class’ object, the output of
          ‘derepFastq’. A list of such objects can be provided, in
          which case each will be denoised with a shared error model.

     err: (Required). 16xN numeric matrix, or an object coercible by
          ‘getErrors’ such as the output of the ‘learnErrors’ function.

          The matrix of estimated rates for each possible nucleotide
          transition (from sample nucleotide to read nucleotide). Rows
          correspond to the 16 possible transitions (t_ij) indexed such
          that 1:A->A, 2:A->C, ..., 16:T->T Columns correspond to
          quality scores. Each entry must be between 0 and 1.

          Typically there are 41 columns for the quality scores 0-40.
          However, if USE_QUALS=FALSE, the matrix must have only one
          column.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, ‘err’ can be set to NULL and an
          initial error matrix will be estimated from the data by
          assuming that all reads are errors away from one true
          sequence.

errorEstimationFunction: (Optional). Function. Default ‘loessErrfun’.

          If USE_QUALS = TRUE,
          ‘errorEstimationFunction(dada()$trans_out)’ is computed after
          sample inference, and the return value is used as the new
          estimate of the err matrix in $err_out.

          If USE_QUALS = FALSE, this argument is ignored, and
          transition rates are estimated by maximum likelihood (t_ij =
          n_ij/n_i).

selfConsist: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default FALSE.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, the algorithm will alternate between
          sample inference and error rate estimation until convergence.
          Error rate estimation is performed by
          ‘errorEstimationFunction’.

          If selfConsist=FALSE the algorithm performs one round of
          sample inference based on the provided ‘err’ matrix.

    pool: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default is FALSE.

          If pool = TRUE, the algorithm will pool together all samples
          prior to sample inference.  If pool = FALSE, sample inference
          is performed on each sample individually.

          This argument has no effect if only 1 sample is provided, and
          ‘pool’ does not affect error rates, which are always
          estimated from pooled observations across samples.

multithread: (Optional). Default is FALSE. If TRUE, multithreading is
          enabled and the number of available threads is automatically
          determined.  If an integer is provided, the number of threads
          to use is set by passing the argument on to
          ‘setThreadOptions’.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE.  Print verbose text output. More
          fine-grained control is available by providing an integer
          argument.

            • 0: Silence. No text output

            • 1: Minimal text output (same as FALSE).

            • 2: Detailed output (same as TRUE).

     ...: (Optional). All dada_opts can be passed in as arguments to
          the dada() function. See ‘setDadaOpt’ for a full list and
          description of these options.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Briefly, ‘dada’ implements a statistical test for the notion that
     a specific sequence was seen too many times to have been caused by
     amplicon errors from currently inferred sample sequences.
     Overly-abundant sequences are used as the seeds of new clusters of
     sequencing reads, and the final set of clusters is taken to
     represent the denoised composition of the sample. A more detailed
     explanation of the algorithm is found in two publications:

        • Callahan BJ, McMurdie PJ, Rosen MJ, Han AW, Johnson AJ,
          Holmes SP (2016). DADA2: High resolution sample inference
          from Illumina amplicon data. Nature Methods, 13(7), 581-3.

        • Rosen MJ, Callahan BJ, Fisher DS, Holmes SP (2012). Denoising
          PCR-amplified metagenome data. BMC bioinformatics, 13(1),
          283.

     ‘dada’ depends on a parametric error model of substitutions. Thus
     the quality of its sample inference is affected by the accuracy of
     the estimated error rates. ‘selfConsist’ mode allows these error
     rates to be inferred from the data.

     All comparisons between sequences performed by ‘dada’ depend on
     pairwise alignments. This step is the most computationally
     intensive part of the algorithm, and two alignment heuristics have
     been implemented for speed: A kmer-distance screen and banded
     Needleman-Wunsch alignmemt. See ‘setDadaOpt’.

Description:

Package:              dada2
Type:                 Package
Title:                Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                      amplicon sequencing data
Description:          The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence
                      variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon
                      sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less
                      accurate OTU clustering approach. The dada2
                      pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
                      files, and outputs the sequence variants and
                      their sample-wise abundances after removing
                      substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                      classification is available via a native
                      implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                      classifier, and genus-species assignment by exact
                      matching.

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A custom interface to ‘FastqStreamer’ for dereplicating amplicon
     sequences from fastq or compressed fastq files, while also
     controlling peak memory requirement to support large files.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     derepFastq(fls, n = 1e+06, verbose = FALSE)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

     fls: (Required). ‘character’. The file path(s) to the fastq or
          fastq.gz file(s). Actually, any file format supported by
          ‘FastqStreamer’.

       n: (Optional). ‘numeric(1)’. The maximum number of records
          (reads) to parse and dereplicate at any one time. This
          controls the peak memory requirement so that large fastq
          files are supported. Default is ‘1e6’, one-million reads. See
          ‘FastqStreamer’ for details on this parameter, which is
          passed on.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE. If TRUE, throw standard R
          ‘message’s on the intermittent and final status of the
          dereplication.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A ‘derep-class’ object or list of such objects.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     # Test that chunk-size, `n`, does not affect the result.
     testFastq = system.file("extdata", "sam1F.fastq.gz", package="dada2")
     derep1 = derepFastq(testFastq, verbose = TRUE)

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The dada function takes as input dereplicated amplicon sequencing
     reads and returns the inferred composition of the sample (or
     samples). Put another way, dada removes all sequencing errors to
     reveal the members of the sequenced community.

     If dada is run in selfConsist=TRUE mode, the algorithm will infer
     both the sample composition and the parameters of its error model
     from the data.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     dada(derep, err, errorEstimationFunction = loessErrfun, selfConsist = FALSE,
       pool = FALSE, multithread = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   derep: (Required). A ‘derep-class’ object, the output of
          ‘derepFastq’. A list of such objects can be provided, in
          which case each will be denoised with a shared error model.

     err: (Required). 16xN numeric matrix, or an object coercible by
          ‘getErrors’ such as the output of the ‘learnErrors’ function.

          The matrix of estimated rates for each possible nucleotide
          transition (from sample nucleotide to read nucleotide). Rows
          correspond to the 16 possible transitions (t_ij) indexed such
          that 1:A->A, 2:A->C, ..., 16:T->T Columns correspond to
          quality scores. Each entry must be between 0 and 1.

          Typically there are 41 columns for the quality scores 0-40.
          However, if USE_QUALS=FALSE, the matrix must have only one
          column.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, ‘err’ can be set to NULL and an
          initial error matrix will be estimated from the data by
          assuming that all reads are errors away from one true
          sequence.

errorEstimationFunction: (Optional). Function. Default ‘loessErrfun’.

          If USE_QUALS = TRUE,
          ‘errorEstimationFunction(dada()$trans_out)’ is computed after
          sample inference, and the return value is used as the new
          estimate of the err matrix in $err_out.

          If USE_QUALS = FALSE, this argument is ignored, and
          transition rates are estimated by maximum likelihood (t_ij =
          n_ij/n_i).

selfConsist: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default FALSE.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, the algorithm will alternate between
          sample inference and error rate estimation until convergence.
          Error rate estimation is performed by
          ‘errorEstimationFunction’.

          If selfConsist=FALSE the algorithm performs one round of
          sample inference based on the provided ‘err’ matrix.

    pool: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default is FALSE.

          If pool = TRUE, the algorithm will pool together all samples
          prior to sample inference.  If pool = FALSE, sample inference
          is performed on each sample individually.

          This argument has no effect if only 1 sample is provided, and
          ‘pool’ does not affect error rates, which are always
          estimated from pooled observations across samples.

multithread: (Optional). Default is FALSE. If TRUE, multithreading is
          enabled and the number of available threads is automatically
          determined.  If an integer is provided, the number of threads
          to use is set by passing the argument on to
          ‘setThreadOptions’.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE.  Print verbose text output. More
          fine-grained control is available by providing an integer
          argument.

            • 0: Silence. No text output

            • 1: Minimal text output (same as FALSE).

            • 2: Detailed output (same as TRUE).

     ...: (Optional). All dada_opts can be passed in as arguments to
          the dada() function. See ‘setDadaOpt’ for a full list and
          description of these options.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Briefly, ‘dada’ implements a statistical test for the notion that
     a specific sequence was seen too many times to have been caused by
     amplicon errors from currently inferred sample sequences.
     Overly-abundant sequences are used as the seeds of new clusters of
     sequencing reads, and the final set of clusters is taken to
     represent the denoised composition of the sample. A more detailed
     explanation of the algorithm is found in two publications:

        • Callahan BJ, McMurdie PJ, Rosen MJ, Han AW, Johnson AJ,
          Holmes SP (2016). DADA2: High resolution sample inference
          from Illumina amplicon data. Nature Methods, 13(7), 581-3.

        • Rosen MJ, Callahan BJ, Fisher DS, Holmes SP (2012). Denoising
          PCR-amplified metagenome data. BMC bioinformatics, 13(1),
          283.

     ‘dada’ depends on a parametric error model of substitutions. Thus
     the quality of its sample inference is affected by the accuracy of
     the estimated error rates. ‘selfConsist’ mode allows these error
     rates to be inferred from the data.

     All comparisons between sequences performed by ‘dada’ depend on
     pairwise alignments. This step is the most computationally
     intensive part of the algorithm, and two alignment heuristics have
     been implemented for speed: A kmer-distance screen and banded
     Needleman-Wunsch alignmemt. See ‘setDadaOpt’.

Description:

Package:              dada2
Type:                 Package
Title:                Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                      amplicon sequencing data
Description:          The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence
                      variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon
                      sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less
                      accurate OTU clustering approach. The dada2
                      pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
                      files, and outputs the sequence variants and
                      their sample-wise abundances after removing
                      substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                      classification is available via a native
                      implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                      classifier, and genus-species assignment by exact
                      matching.

          ‘FastqStreamer’.

       n: (Optional). ‘numeric(1)’. The maximum number of records
          (reads) to parse and dereplicate at any one time. This
          controls the peak memory requirement so that large fastq
          files are supported. Default is ‘1e6’, one-million reads. See

_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The dada function takes as input dereplicated amplicon sequencing
     reads and returns the inferred composition of the sample (or
     samples). Put another way, dada removes all sequencing errors to
     reveal the members of the sequenced community.

     If dada is run in selfConsist=TRUE mode, the algorithm will infer
     both the sample composition and the parameters of its error model
     from the data.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     dada(derep, err, errorEstimationFunction = loessErrfun, selfConsist = FALSE,
       pool = FALSE, multithread = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   derep: (Required). A ‘derep-class’ object, the output of
          ‘derepFastq’. A list of such objects can be provided, in
          which case each will be denoised with a shared error model.

     err: (Required). 16xN numeric matrix, or an object coercible by
          ‘getErrors’ such as the output of the ‘learnErrors’ function.

          The matrix of estimated rates for each possible nucleotide
          transition (from sample nucleotide to read nucleotide). Rows
          correspond to the 16 possible transitions (t_ij) indexed such
          that 1:A->A, 2:A->C, ..., 16:T->T Columns correspond to
          quality scores. Each entry must be between 0 and 1.

          Typically there are 41 columns for the quality scores 0-40.
          However, if USE_QUALS=FALSE, the matrix must have only one
          column.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, ‘err’ can be set to NULL and an
          initial error matrix will be estimated from the data by
          assuming that all reads are errors away from one true
          sequence.

errorEstimationFunction: (Optional). Function. Default ‘loessErrfun’.

          If USE_QUALS = TRUE,
          ‘errorEstimationFunction(dada()$trans_out)’ is computed after
          sample inference, and the return value is used as the new
          estimate of the err matrix in $err_out.

          If USE_QUALS = FALSE, this argument is ignored, and
          transition rates are estimated by maximum likelihood (t_ij =
          n_ij/n_i).

selfConsist: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default FALSE.

          If selfConsist = TRUE, the algorithm will alternate between
          sample inference and error rate estimation until convergence.
          Error rate estimation is performed by
          ‘errorEstimationFunction’.

          If selfConsist=FALSE the algorithm performs one round of
          sample inference based on the provided ‘err’ matrix.

    pool: (Optional). ‘logical(1)’. Default is FALSE.

          If pool = TRUE, the algorithm will pool together all samples
          prior to sample inference.  If pool = FALSE, sample inference
          is performed on each sample individually.

          This argument has no effect if only 1 sample is provided, and
          ‘pool’ does not affect error rates, which are always
          estimated from pooled observations across samples.

multithread: (Optional). Default is FALSE. If TRUE, multithreading is
          enabled and the number of available threads is automatically
          determined.  If an integer is provided, the number of threads
          to use is set by passing the argument on to
          ‘setThreadOptions’.

 verbose: (Optional). Default FALSE.  Print verbose text output. More
          fine-grained control is available by providing an integer
          argument.

            • 0: Silence. No text output

            • 1: Minimal text output (same as FALSE).

            • 2: Detailed output (same as TRUE).

     ...: (Optional). All dada_opts can be passed in as arguments to
          the dada() function. See ‘setDadaOpt’ for a full list and
          description of these options.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Briefly, ‘dada’ implements a statistical test for the notion that
     a specific sequence was seen too many times to have been caused by
     amplicon errors from currently inferred sample sequences.
     Overly-abundant sequences are used as the seeds of new clusters of
     sequencing reads, and the final set of clusters is taken to
     represent the denoised composition of the sample. A more detailed
     explanation of the algorithm is found in two publications:

        • Callahan BJ, McMurdie PJ, Rosen MJ, Han AW, Johnson AJ,
          Holmes SP (2016). DADA2: High resolution sample inference
          from Illumina amplicon data. Nature Methods, 13(7), 581-3.

        • Rosen MJ, Callahan BJ, Fisher DS, Holmes SP (2012). Denoising
          PCR-amplified metagenome data. BMC bioinformatics, 13(1),
          283.

     ‘dada’ depends on a parametric error model of substitutions. Thus
     the quality of its sample inference is affected by the accuracy of
     the estimated error rates. ‘selfConsist’ mode allows these error
     rates to be inferred from the data.

     All comparisons between sequences performed by ‘dada’ depend on
     pairwise alignments. This step is the most computationally
     intensive part of the algorithm, and two alignment heuristics have
     been implemented for speed: A kmer-distance screen and banded
     Needleman-Wunsch alignmemt. See ‘setDadaOpt’.

Description:

Package:              dada2
Type:                 Package
Title:                Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                      amplicon sequencing data
Description:          The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence
                      variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon
                      sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less
                      accurate OTU clustering approach. The dada2
                      pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
                      files, and outputs the sequence variants and
                      their sample-wise abundances after removing
                      substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                      classification is available via a native
                      implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                      classifier, and genus-species assignment by exact
                      matching.

Description:

Package:              dada2
Type:                 Package
Title:                Accurate, high-resolution sample inference from
                      amplicon sequencing data
Description:          The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence
                      variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon
                      sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less
                      accurate OTU clustering approach. The dada2
                      pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq
                      files, and outputs the sequence variants and
                      their sample-wise abundances after removing
                      substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
                      classification is available via a native
                      implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian
                      classifier, and genus-species assignment by exact
                      matching.
