## Analysis pipeline

_1_reads_to_ASVs.R_
This is the DADA2 pipeline which goes all the way from raw reads to 
amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)

_2_prep_data.R_
This script does some more preprocessing on the ASVs and integrates
other sampling data, such as health.

_3_filter_ASVs.R_
Here, we do some more quality control and filtering of the ASVs.

_4_full_analysis.R_
This script contains the code to reproduce all analyses and figures 
in the paper and the supplementary material.

### Other scripts
All other scripts are helper scripts which were used to to quality control
for the microsatellites, or contain code for plotting or manipulation 
of microbiome data.

### Folders
data contains all the data necessary to run script 4 with all analyses.
